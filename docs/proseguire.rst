This guide has touched only a minimal part of the tools offered by git. 

git is a system made of more than 150 commands. each of which would require a specific chapter. 

In order to have a complete list of available commands, run ``git help -a``


.. code-block:: bash

    git help -a

    git commands available from elsewhere on your $PATH

      credential-osxkeychain  subtree
    
    'git help -a' and 'git help -g' lists available subcommands and some
    concept guides. See 'git help <command>' or 'git help <concept>'
    to read about a specific subcommand or concept.


Probably the best way to know the details of each command is reading the respective *man page*. 

To access the ``merge`` *man page* you have simply to run

.. code-block:: bash

    git help merge


and you may do the same for the other commands.

But don't get scared, you will not need to read the documantation of all commands: 
use the *man pages* as *reference guide* to be consulted when necessary, when you will need details on the specific command. 


Learn git branching
###################

Rather than jumping again in lengthy readings , I suggest to start practising.

A very amusing system to take familiarity with git is the wonderful `Learn git branching <http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/?demo>`_,
a very practical and very challenging, made of a set of exercises with increasing difficulty.

I consider it a must. 

Face it, and make the effort of reaching the end : it deserves very much. 

ProGit
######


A much more practical and discursive reading than *man pages* is the lovely Scott Chacon's ProGit.

You may buy the book `su Amazon <http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Git-Scott-Chacon/dp/1430218339>`_ or 
you can read it `for free online <http://www.git-scm.com/book>`_.

I warmly suggest to you to dedicate time to it: it's considered one of the best books on git in circulation.
