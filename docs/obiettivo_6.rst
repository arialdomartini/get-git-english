Target 6: placing the ``repository`` on the network
###################################################

So far you have interacted only with your local ``repository`` , but I had
anticipated that git is a *peer-to-peer* system.

In general, this means that your ``repository`` is a node that can
become part of a network and exchange informations with other nodes, 
that is with other ``repositories``.

A part from your local ``repository``, any other ``repository``
--no matter if it's on GitHub, on a company's server or simply in a different 
directory of your computer-- for git it's a 
``remote``.

To link your local ``repository`` to a ``remote`` it needs just to
give git the address of the remote ``repository`` with the command
``git remote`` (of course, you need also read and write permissions on ``remote``)

To make things simple, let's make a concrete example without 
involving external servers and the Internet; create another ``repository`` 
somewhere on your very computer 

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ..
    mkdir remote-repo
    cd remote-repo
    git init

In this case, in the directory of your project, the remote ``repository``
will be reachable through the path ``../remote-repo`` or with its absolute path.
But, more commonly, you wil deal with remote ``repositories`` that are reachable, depending on 
the protocol that is used, with addresses like

-  ``https://azienda.com/repositories/cool-project2.git``
-  ``git@github.com:johncarpenter/mytool.git``.

For instance, the ``repository`` of this guide has the address
 
-  ``git@github.com:arialdomartini/get-git-english.git``.

Very often it also happens that access to a ``remote`` requires an
authentication. In this case, usually, it's used a user/password pair
or a ssh key.

Go back to your project

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ../project

Well. Add to the ``remote`` list the just created ``repository`` , 
indicating to git whatever name and the address of the ``remote``

.. code-block:: bash

    git remote add foobar ../remote-repo

Very good. You have linked your ``repository`` to another node. You are
officially in a *peer-to-peer* network of ``repositories``. From this moment,
when you want to make reference to that remote ``repository``, you will use 
the name ``foobar``.

The name is necessary because, differently from SVN that has the concept of
*central server*, in git you may be linked to whatever number of remote
``repositories`` at the same time, therefore you will assign a unique identifier to each of them.

There are two things that you fundamentally may do with a ``remote``:
to align with its content or ask it for aligning with you.

Two commands are available: ``push`` and ``fetch``.

With ``push`` you can *deliver* a set of ``commits`` to the remote ``repository``.
With ``fetch`` you can *receive them* from the remote ``repository``.

Both ``push`` and ``fetch``, actually, allow that your ``repository``
and the ``remote`` exchange labels. And, indeed, you have also other commands 
available. But let's go step by step: let's start to see in concrete how 
the communication between a ``repository``and a ``remote`` works.

Delivering a branch with ``push``
=================================

At the moment the ``remote`` that you named ``foobar`` is a completely empty ``repository``:
you just created it. Your local ``repository`` , instead, contains many
``commits`` and many ``branches``:

.. figure:: img/local-1.png

Try to ask the remote ``repository`` for giving you the ``commits`` and the
``branches`` which has available and which you don't have. If you don't indicate a
specific ``branch`` , the remote ``repository`` will try to give you all of them.
In your case the ``remote`` is empty, therefore it shouldn't give back to you anything

.. code-block:: bash

    git fetch foobar

In fact. You don't receive anything. 

Try instead to deliver the branch
``experiment``

.. code-block:: bash

    git push foobar experiment
    Counting objects: 14, done. 
    Delta compression using up to 4 threads. 
    Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done. 
    Writing objects: 100% (14/14), 1.07 KiB \| 0 bytes/s, done.
    Total 14 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0) To ../remote-repo
    [new branch] experiment -> experiment

Wow! Something happened! Among all the response messages, at this moment the 
most interesting is the last one 

.. code-block:: bash

    [new branch] experiment -> experiment

I help you to interpret what has happened:

-  with ``git push foobar experiment`` you asked git for sending
   ``foobar`` the ``experiment`` branch 
-  to execute the command git took into consideration your branch 
   ``experiment`` and drew the list of all ``commits`` reachable from 
   that branch (as a usual: they are all the ``commits``
   which you may find starting from ``experiment`` and following backward 
   in time any path you may go through)
-  git has then contacted the remote ``repository`` ``foobar`` to know
   which of those ``commits`` were not present remotely
-  after that, it created a packet with all the necessary ``commits`` ,
   delivered them and asked the remote ``repository`` to add them
   to its own database
-  the ``remote`` has placed its ``branch`` ``experiment``
   so that it pointed exactly the same ``commit`` pointed on your local
   ``repository`` . The ``remote`` didn't have that ``branch``, therefore it created it.

Now try to visualize the remote ``repository``

.. figure:: img/remote-1.png

Do you see? The ``remote`` has not become a copy of your ``repository``:
it contains only the ``branch`` that you sent it.

You may verify that the 4 ``commits`` really are all and only the 
``commits`` that you had in local on the ``experiment`` branch.

Even on your local ``repository`` something happened. try to visualize it

.. figure:: img/push-1.png

Look look! It seems a new ``branch``, called
``foobar/experiment``, has been added. and it also seems that it's a little particular
``branch``, because the interface is concerned to draw it in a different colour.

Try to delete that ``branch``

.. code-block:: bash

    git branch -d foobar/experiment
    error: branch 'foobar/experiment' not found.

It cannot br deleted. git says that ``branch`` doesn't exist. Uhm.
That label has really something particular!

The fact is that ``branch`` is not on your ``repository``: it's on 
``foobar``. git has added a ``remote branch`` in order to allow you to 
keep track of the fact that on ``foobar`` the ``branch`` ``experiment``
is just pointing to that ``commit``.

``remote branches`` are a sort of reminder that allow you to understand
where are the ``branches`` on remote ``repositories`` you are linked with.

It's one of those subjects that may result less clear to new git users, 
but if you think of it, the concept is not difficult at all. With the 
``remote branch`` called ``foobar/experiment`` git is simply tellin you 
that the ``branch`` ``experiment`` on the  ``foobar`` ``repository`` is
in correspondence of that ``commit``.

As well as you can't delete that ``branch`` you can not even move it directly.
The only manner to gain direct control on that ``branch``is to access directly 
the ``foobar`` ``repository``.

But you have an indirect way to control delivering with ``push`` an update of the 
``experiment`` ``branch``; we had seen before that the``push`` request is always 
accompanied by the request of update of the position of your ``branch``.


Before trying with a concrete example, I'd like to recall your attention on 
a verty important aspect, that you will have to het used to: while you were 
reading these lines, a colleague of yours could have added some ``commit`` 
just on his ``branch`` ``experiment`` on his remote ``repository``, and 
you wouldn't know anything, because your ``repository`` is not linked in 
real time its ``remotes``, but synchronizes only when you interact with 
proper commands. Therefore, the ``commit`` pointed by ``foobar/experiment`` 
has to be meant as the last known position of the ``experiment``  ``branch``
on ``foobar``.

Receiving uodates with ``fetch``
================================

Let's try and simulate this last case. 
Change `foobar` as if a colleague of yours is working on ``experiment``. 

That is: add a ``commit`` on the ``experiment`` branch of ``foobar``

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ../repo-remoto
    touch x
    git add x
    git commit -m "a contribution from your colleague" 

Here you have the final result on ``foobar``

.. figure:: img/push-2.png

Go back to your local``repository`` and let's see what has chenged

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ../project

.. figure:: img/push-1.png

In fact. It has not changed anything at all. Your local``repository`` 
continues saying that the ``experiment`` branch on ``foobar`` stays at
"*a commit with an experiment*\ ". And you know very well that it's not true!
``foobar`` has gone forward, and your ``repository`` doesn't know it.

All this is coherentwith what I said before: your
``repository`` is not linked in real time with its ``remote``; matching 
is just on command.

Then ask your ``repository`` for matching with ``foobar``. You
may ask for an update on a single branch or on all of them.
Usually it's chosen the second way.

.. code-block:: bash

    git fetch foobar
    remote: Counting objects: 3, done. remote:
    Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done. remote: Total 2 (delta 1),
    reused 0 (delta 0) Unpacking objects: 100% (2/2), done. 
    From ../repo-remoto
    e5bb7c4..c8528bb experiment -> foobar/experiment

Something has arrived.

Look again at the new local ``repository``. (In order to simplify our life,
let's start to take advantage from an option present in every git's graphic 
interface: the capability of visualizing a single branch andhiding al the 
others, so that final result can be simplified) 

.. figure:: img/push-3.png

Carefully look at what has happened: your ``experiment`` branch
didn't move at all. If you check, your 
``file system`` hasn't absolutely changed as well. Just your local
``repository`` has been updated: git added there a new 
``commit``, the same remotely added; at the same time, git has also 
updated  the ``foobar/experiment`` position, in order to communicate 
that "*according with latest available information, last position of 
the branch ``experiment`` recorded on ``foobar`` is this*\ ".

This is the way with which normally git allows you to know that 
someone continued his work an a remote ``repository`` .

Another important remark: ``fetch`` is not equivalent to 
``svn update``; only your local ``repository`` is synced to
the remote one; your ``file system`` has not changed! This generally means that
``fetch`` is a very safe operatuon: even though you should sync
with a dubious quality ``repository``, you can rest easy, 
because the operation will never do the 
``merge`` on your code without your explicit intervention.

If instead you really want to include the remotely introduced changes in 
*your* work, you could use the ``merge`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

    git merge foobar/experiment

.. figure:: img/push-4.png

Do you recognize the kind of ``merge`` that resulted? Yes, a
``fast-forward``. INterpret it this way: your  ``merge`` has been a
``fast-forward`` because while your colleague was working the branch 
has not been modified by anyone else; your colleague has been the only one 
who added contributions, and development has been linear.

This is such a common case that you will want to avoid doing
``git fetch`` followed by ``git merge``: git offers the 
``git pull`` command, which executes the two commands together.

Therefore, instead of

.. code-block:: bash

    git fetch foobar
    git merge foobar/experiment

you should have run

.. code-block:: bash

    git pull foobar experiment

We can extend the diagram of te interactions between git commands and
its environments adding the ``remote`` column and the action of
``push``, ``fetch`` e ``pull``

.. figure:: img/push-fetch.png

Non linear development
======================

Let's try to complicate the situation. I would like to show a case that
will contnously happen: two developers are working on a branch at the same time,
on two separated ``repositories`` . It usuallyhappens that at the moment when you 
will want to send your new ``commits``to ``remote``  , you discover that, 
in the meantime, someone on the remote
``repository`` changed the``branch``.

Start to simulate your colleague's work progress, adding
a ``commit`` on its ``repository``

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ../repo-remoto
    touch progress && git add progress
    git commit -m "a new commit of your colleague"

.. figure:: img/collaborating-1.png

(En passant, note this: on the remote ``repository`` there's no indication
of your ``repository``; git is an asymmetric peer-to-peer system)

Go back to your ``repository``

.. figure:: img/push-4.png

Like before: as soon as yo don't explicitly ask for an alignment with
``fetch`` your ``repository`` doesn't know anything of your new ``commit``.

By the way, this is one of the remarkable git's features: being
compatible with the strongly non linear nature of development activities.
Think it over: when two developers works on a single branch,
SVN requires that every ``commit`` is preceded by an ``update``; that is,
in order to record a change the developer has to integrate preventively the 
other developer's work. You cannot run a 
``commit`` if you beforehand don't integrate your colleague's ``commits`` . 
git, on this viewpoint, is less demanding: developers mayduverge locally, 
even working on the same ``branch``; the decision if and how to integrate their work 
may be intentionally and indefinitely moved on in time.

Anyway: embrace the strongly non linear git's nature and, purposely ignoring that there
could have been progresses on the remote ``repository`` , proceed locally without delay 
with your new ``commits``

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ../progetto
    touch my-contribution && git add my-contribution
    git commit -m "a new commit of mine"

.. figure:: img/collaborating-2.png

Let's assess again the situation on what I have just described:

-  your ``repository`` doesn't know about the new ``commit`` recorded on
   ``foobar`` and continues to see a non up to date situation
-  starting with the same ``commit`` "*a contribution from your colleague*\ "
   you and the other developer have recorde two completely indipendent ``commits``.
   
Having worked concurrently on the same branch, with two potentially incompatible ``commits`` is
if you think of it, a little like working concurrently on the same file with potentially incompatible changes:
when the two results will be put together, we can expect that a conflict is reported. 

And infact it's just like this. The confict arises at the moment when 
we try to sync the two ``repositories``. For example: try to send 
your branch on ``foobar``

.. code-block:: bash

    git push foobar experiment
    To ../repo-remoto ! [rejected]
    experiment -> experiment (fetch first) 
    error: failed to push some refs to '../repo-remoto' 
    hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do 
    hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing 
    hint: to the same ref.  You may want to first integrate the remote changes 
    hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again. 
    hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

Rejected. Failed. Error. It's more than evident that the operation has not 
been successful. And we could expect it. With
``git push foobar experiment`` you had asked ``foobar`` for completing two operations:

-  saving in its database all yours ``commits`` that are not yet remotely present
-  moving its  ``experiment`` label so that it points the same``commit`` that is pointed locally

Now: about first operation there would have been no problem. 
But about the second one git sets a supplemental costraint:
the remote ``repository`` will move its label only on condition that the 
operation can be completed with a ``fast-forward``, that is, only on 
condition that it's not necessary to execute ``merges``. 
Or, said in different word: a ``remote`` accepts a ``branch`` 
only if the operation doesn't create diverging development lines.

``fast-forward`` is mentioned just on the last line of the error message


.. code-block:: bash

    hint: **See the 'Note about fast-forwards'** in 'git push --help'
    for details.<br/

In the same message git provides a tip: it suggests to try to ``fetch``. Let's try

.. code-block:: bash

    git fetch foobar

.. figure:: img/collaborating-3.png

The situation should be clear at a glance. You can see that the two development lines are diverging. 
The position of the two branches helps in understanding where you are locally and where your colleague is 
on the ``remote`` ``foobar``.

We have just to decide what to do. Unlike SVN, that in front of this situatuon
would have necessarily required a local merge,
git leaves to you three possibilities

-  **going on ignoring the colleague**: you may ignore your colleague's
    work and continue on your development line;of course, you will not 
    be able tp deliver you branch on ``foobar``, because it's incompatible
    with your colleague's work (even though you may deliver your work assigning 
    to your development line another name, creating a new ``branch`` and ``pushing`` it); 
    however, the concept is that you're not obliged to integrate your colleague's work;
-  **``merge``**: you may melt your work with your colleague's one with a ``merge``
-  **``rebase``**\ you mat realign to youer colleague's work with a ``rebase``

Try the third of these possibilities. Nay, in order to insist on the non linear nature
of git, try to make the first way precede the third. In other words,
try to see what happens if, temporarily, you ignore the misalignment with your colleague's 
work and you keep on developing on your line. It's a very common case: You know you have to 
align, sooner or later, with the others' work, but you want complete your work, beforehand. 
git doesn't dictate timing and doesn't oblige you to anticipate things you don't want to do
anon. 

.. code-block:: bash

    echo change >> my-contribution
    git commit -am "I progress the same"

.. figure:: img/collaborating-4.png

Very well. You went on with your work, misaligning even more with your colleague's 
work. Let's suppose that you decide the moment ha arrived for realigning, and then
delivering your work to ``foobar``.

You might run ``git merge foobar/experiment`` and obtain this situation 

.. figure:: img/collaborating-5.png

Do you see? Now ``foobar/experiment`` could be pushed forward (with
a ``fast-forward``) till ``experiment``. Then, you could run ``git push foobar``.

But instead of doing a ``merge``, do something more sophisticated: use
``rebase``. Look again at the current situation 
.. figure:: img/collaborating-3.png

With respect to the works on ``foobar`` it's like you had detached a development branch
but, unfortunately, while you were making changes, 
``foobar`` has not waited for you and has been modified.

Well: if you remember, ``rebase`` allows you to apply all your changes to another
``commit``; you could apply your branch to ``foobar/experiment``. It's like you could sharply
detach your branch ``experiment`` and reattach on another base
(``foobar/experiment``)

Try

.. code-block:: bash

    git rebase foobar/experiment

.. figure:: img/collaborating-6.png

Have you seen? To all effects it appears as if you had started your work
*after* the end of works on ``foobar``. In other words:
``rebase`` has apparently made linear the development process, that was
inherently non linear, without forcing you to align with your colleague's work
exactly in the moments when it was adding s
``commits`` to its ``repository``.

You may deliver your work to ``foobar``: it will appear like you have made your changes 
starting with the last ``commit`` done on 
``foobar``.

.. code-block:: bash

    **git push foobar experiment**\  
    Counting objects: 6, done. 
    Delta compression using up to 4 threads. 
    Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done. 
    Writing objects: 100% (5/5), 510 bytes \| 0 bytes/s, done.
    Total 5 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0) 
    remote: error: refusing to update checked out branch: refs/heads/experiment 
    remote: error: By default, updating the current branch in a non-bare repository

    tree >inconsistent 
    remote: error: with what you pushed, and will require 'git reset --hard' to match 
    remote: error: the work tree to HEAD. 
    remote: error: remote: error: You can set 'receive.denyCurrentBranch' configuration variable to

    To ../repo-remoto ! [remote rejected] experiment -> experiment (branch is currently checked out)
    error: failed to push some refs to '../repo-remoto'

My God! It really looks like git didn't like this ``push`` .
In the very long error message git is saying that it may not 
``push`` a ``branch`` currently "*checked out*\ ": 
the problem doesn't like to be in``push`` itself, but in the fact 
that on the other ``repository`` your colleague did ``checkout experiment``.

THis issue could continously happen, if you don't know how to face it,
therefore we will soon dedicate a little time to it. For now,
repair gently asking your colleague for moving on another branch and repeat ``push``.

Then: on ``foobar`` move on another ``branch``

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ../remote-repo
    git checkout -b parking

And afterwards, go back to your local ``repository`` and repeat ``push``

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ../project
    git push foobar experiment
Here you have the result

.. figure:: img/collaborating-7.png

Let's run graphically through what has happened. You were leaving from

.. figure:: img/collaborating-4.png

Then you did ``rebase`` and you obtained

.. figure:: img/collaborating-6.png

Then you did ``push`` on ``foobar``: the new position of the
``remote branch`` ``foobar/experiment`` is witnessing the progress of the branch 
also on the remote ``repository`` .

.. figure:: img/collaborating-7.png

Simultaneously, your colleague on ``foobar`` saw its  ``repository`` 
passing from

.. figure:: img/collaborating-1.png

to

.. figure:: img/collaborating-8.png

Do you get everything? Look carefully at the last two images, because
it's just in order to avoid what you are seeing that git complained that much,
when you run ``git push foobar experiment``.

In order to understand it, put yourself in the shoes of your virtual colleague,
that we imagined on the remote ``repository`` ``foobar``. Your colleagues is 
staying quiet on the ``experiment`` branch

.. figure:: img/collaborating-1.png

when suddenly , without he gave any command to git, his
``repository`` accepts the request of ``push``, stores in the local database
a couple of new``commits`` and moves the ``experiment`` (yes,
just the branch of which he run the ``checkout``!) branch two ``commit`` forward

.. figure:: img/collaborating-8.png

You will admit that if this was the standard behaviour of git,
you would never find yourself in your virtual colleague's position:
loss of control of your ``repository`` and of your 
``file system`` would be a too high price to be paid.

You well undestand that changing the branch where you did ``checkout``
sunstantially means seeing your 
``file system`` change under your feet. Of course this is totally unacceptable,
and for this reason git refused proceding and replied with a lengthy error message

You before remedied the situation moving your virtual colleague on a ``parking`` branch, 
just for being able to send it your branch.

.. figure:: img/collaborating-9.png

This dirty trick allowed you to ``push``  ``experiment``.

But thinking about it this is as well a solution you probably will never accept: 
aside from the convenience of having to suspend just because a colleague wants to deliver his code,
however you wouldn't like that the progress of your branches is 
completely out of your control, at the mercy of anyone. Because, in the end
the ``experiment`` branch would move forward against your will, and it could happen the same
to all the branches that you did not ``checkout``.

It's evident that a radical solution to this problem must exist.

The solution is amazingly simple: **you don't allow others to access your ``repository``**.

You might find it a somewhat cursory solution, but you should recognize 
that a more drastic and effective system doesn't exist. And, fortunately, 
it's much less limiting than you could expect at a first analysis.

Of course I told you only half of the story and maybe it's worth
to deepen a little the matter. Open very well your mind, 
because now you are getting to the heart of a very fascinating subject:
git's distributed nature. It's likely to be the most commonly unappreciated aspect of git
and, nearly dertainly one of its most powerful features.
