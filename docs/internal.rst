3 main differences
##################

Let's start with three git's features you should become familiar with.

1. **There's no server**: the repository is local. Most operations are 
   local and don't require network access. Also for this reason you will find
   git incredibly fast. 
2. **The project is indivisible**: git always works with the whole 
   source code of the project and not on single directories or files;
   between committing in the main directory or in a sub-directory there's
   no difference. The concept ``checkout`` of a single file or directory 
   doesn't exist. git assumes the project as the indivisible unit of work.
3. **git doesn't memorize files' changes**: git always saves files in 
   full. If you modify a single character of a 2 mega file, git memorizes
   in full the new version of the file.
   This is an important difference: SVN memorizes the differences and, 
   when required, rebuilds the file; git memorizes the file and, when 
   required, rebuilds the differences.

4 levels of *offline* operations
================================

Re the absence of a server i lied a little: as I already said and as you
will see later, git is a *peer-to-peer* system, and it can interact with 
remote servers. Despite this, it remains a substantially local system.

In order to better understand how this can benefit you, try to see what 
follows: when a project's source code is hosted on a remote computer,
you have four ways to edit the code

1. You leave all the code on the remote computer and  **access it with 
   ssh to edit a single file**
2. You find the way to obtain **a copy of the single file** so that you
   can work on it in local more comfortably, and you leave all the rest
   on the remote computer
3. You find the way to obtain **a local copy of a whole file system 
   tree** and leave the rest of commits' history on the remote computer
4. You obtain **a local copy of the whole repository** with the whole 
   history of the project and you work locally.

You may have noticed two things.

First, SVN and other versioning systems you might be used to,
operate at level 3.

Second, the 4 systems are listed in order of convenience: in principle, when the 
material stays on the remote system, your work becomes more intricate, slow
and umcomfortable. SVN allows you to checkout a whole directory precisely
because in this way you find more comfortable to pass from one file to 
another without need to interact continually with the remote server.

git is even more extreme; it prefers that you have everything at hand on
your local computer; not just the single checkout, but the whole history
of the project, from first to last commit.

In fact, whatever you want to do, git normally asks to get a complete copy
of what is present on the remote server. But don't worry too much: git is
faster in getting the whole history of the project than SVN is in getting a
single checkout.

The storage model
=================

Let's pass now to third difference. And be prepared to know the true reason
why git going to substitute SVN as the new *de-facto* standard very quichly,

-  SVN memorizes the collection of various changes applied to files during time; when 
   required it rebuilds the present state; 
-  git memorizes files as they are, in full; when required it computes their 
   deltas.

If you want to avoid many headaches with git, the best suggestion you can follow
is to treat it as a **key/value database**.

Now go to your terminal and look in concrete.

Put yourself in the condition to have two empty files on your file system:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir project
    cd project 
    mkdir libs 
    touch libs/foo.txt 
    mkdir templates 
    touch templates/bar.txt

::

    /
    ├──libs
    |     └──foo.txt
    |
    ├──templates
            └──bar.txt

Let's decide to manage the project with git

.. code-block:: bash

    git init

Add the first file to git

.. code-block:: bash

    git add libs/foo.txt

With this command, git inspects the content of the file (it's empty!) and
memorizes it on its key/value database, named ``Object Database`` and
stored on the file system in the  ``.git`` hidden directory.

Since the ``blob-storage`` is a key/value database, git will try to
compute a key and a value for the file you have added. For the value it 
will use tha same content of the file; for the key, it will compute the 
SHA1 of the content (if you are curious, in case of an empty file it's
``e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391``)

So, in the ``Object Database`` git will save a ``blob`` object,
uniquely identifiable by its key (that, in absence of ambiguity, it's 
worth to shorten) 

.. figure:: img/blob.png
   
Now add the second file

.. code-block:: bash

    git add templates/bar.txt

Now, since ``libs/foo.txt`` and ``templates/bar.txt`` have the same identical 
content (they are both empty!), in the ``Object Database`` they are going to
be stored both in a single object: 

.. figure:: img/blob.png

   
As you can see, in the ``Object Database`` git has memorized only the file 
content, and not its name or its location. 

But of course we are very interested in file names and locations, aren't we? 
For this reason, in the ``Object Database``, git memorizes also other objects, 
named ``trees`` that serve just to memorize the content of the different 
directories and the file names.

In our case, we will have 3 ``trees``

.. figure:: img/tree.png

   
As any other object, also ``trees`` are memorized as key/value objects.

All these structures are collected in a container, called ``commit``.

.. figure:: img/commit.png

   
As you have probably guessed, a ``commit`` is nothing more than an item
of the key/value database, whose key is a SHA1, as for all
other objects, and whose value is a pointer to the project's ``tree`` ,
that is its key (together with some other information, like creation date, 
comment and author). In the end it's not that much complicated, isn't it?


So, the ``commit`` is the present photography of the file system.

Now type

.. code-block:: bash

    git commit -m "commit A, my first commit"

You are saying to git:

*memorize in the repository, that is in the project's history, the commit 
I have prepared by several adds*

Your ``repository``, seen by SmartGit, has now this aspect:

.. figure:: img/first-commit.png

   
The line with bullet that you see on the left represents the ``commit``
object. In the panel on the right, instead, you may see the ``commit`` key.

In general, unless we want to speak precisely of the internal model, as
we are doing now, there's not a great need to represent the whole structure
of  ``blobs`` and ``trees`` that constitutes a ``commit``. In fact, after 
the next paragraph we will start to represent the ``commit`` like in the figure
above: with a simple bullet.

Even now, however, for you it should be clearer that inside a ``commit`` 
there is the whole photography of the project and a ``commit`` actually is
the minimal and indivisible unit of work.

The ``index`` or ``staging area``
===============================

Substantially, that's not much more that you have to know about git's storage
model. But before we pass to see the various commands, I'd like to introduce 
another internal mechanism: the ``staging area`` or ``index``. The ``index` always 
results a mystery if one comes from SVN: it's worth to speak about it,
because when you know how ``Object Database`` and ``index`` work, no longer will 
git appear to you intricate and incomprehensible; rather, you will get its coherence
and you'll find it extremely predictable. 

The ``index`` is a structure that acts as a pad between ``file system`` and 
``repository``. It's a small buffer you can use tu build your next ``commit``.

.. figure:: img/index1.png

   
It's not that much complicated:

-  the ``file system`` is the directory with your files
-  the ``repository`` is the local database on file that stores the various
   ``commits``
-  the ``index`` is the space that git provides you to create next ``commit`` 
before recording it definetely on the ``repository``.

Physically, ``index`` is not very different from ``repository``:
both store data in the ``Object Database``, using the structures you have 
seen above.

At this moment, just after having completed your first ``commit``,
the ``index`` stores a copy of your last ``commit`` and expects that you
modify it.

.. figure:: img/index2.png

On file system you have

::

    /
    ├──libs
    |     └──foo.txt
    |
    ├──templates
            └──bar.txt

Let's try to da some changes to file ``foo.txt``

.. code-block:: bash

    echo "in the middle of the way" >> libs/foo.txt

and update the ``index`` with

.. code-block:: bash

    git add libs/foo.txt

Here you have another difference from SVN: in SVN ``add`` serves to put
a file under versioning and it has to be executed only once; in git it serves
to save a file inside the ``index`` and it's an operation that has to be 
repeated at every ``commit``.

When you run ``git add`` , git repeats what it had already done before:
it analyzes the content of ``libs/foo.txt``, it sees that there's a content it
has never recorded and therefore it adds to the ``Object Database`` a new
``blob`` with the new content of the file; contestually, it updates the ``tree`` 
``libs`` so that the pointer named``foo.txt`` addresses its new content.

.. figure:: img/index3.png

Go on adding a new file ``doh.html`` to the project's root

.. code-block:: bash

    echo "happy happy joy joy" > doh.html
    git add doh.html

Like before: git adds a new ``blob`` object with the file's content and,
contestually, adds in the "/" ``tree``  a new pointer named ``doh.html`` 
that points to the new ``blob`` object
 
.. figure:: img/index4.png

The container of all this structure is always a ``commit`` object;
git keeps it parked in the ``staging area`` waiting for you to send to
the ``repository``. This structure exactly represents the new situation on
file system: it's again a photography of the whole project, and it includes 
also the ``bar.txt`` file, despite you have now modified it. Incidentally:
you shouldn't worry for space usage because, as you can see, to memorize 
``bar.txt`` git is reusing the ``blob`` object it created in the previous 
``commit``, in order to avoid duplications.

Well. Now we have a new photography of the project. But we are interested in
git storing also the history of our file system, therefore it'll be needed
to memorize somewhere the fact that this new situation (the present ``index`` 
state) is daughter of the previous situation (the previous ``commit``).

In effect, git adds authomatically to the ``commit`` parked in the ``staging 
area`` a pointer to the source ``commit``

.. figure:: img/index-and-first-commit.png

The arrow represents the fact that the ``index`` is son of ``commit A``. It
is a simple point. No surprise, if you think of it; git, after all, uses the
same, usual, very simple model everywhere: a key/value database to store the
data, and a key as pointer between one element and the other. 

Ok. Now commit

.. code-block:: bash

    git commit -m "Commit B, My second commit"

With the commit operation you're saying to git "*Ok, take the present
``index`` and make it become your new ``commit``. Then give me back
the ``index`` so that I can make a new change*\ "

After the ``commit`` in git's database you will have 

.. figure:: img/index-and-second-commit.png

A short remark: git's graphic interfaces often omit visualizing the
``index``. ``gitk``, for instance, shows it only if there are changes
to be committed. Your repository in ``gitk`` is now visualized this
way

.. figure:: img/gitk.png

See for yourself. Launch

.. code-block:: bash

    gitk

Recapping:

1. git always memorizes files in full
2. the ``commit`` is one of the several objects stored into git's 
   key/value database. It's a container of many pointers to other 
   objects in the database: the ``trees``, that represent directories, 
   that in turn point to other ``trees`` (sub-directory) or to ``blobs``
   (files' content)
3. every ``commit`` object has a pointer to its father ``commit``, from
   which it comes
4. The ``index`` is a support space where you can build, with different 
   ``git add``, the new ``commit``
5. with ``git commit`` you record the present ``index`` making it become 
   the new ``commit``.



.. figure:: img/index-add-commit.png



Ok: now you have all the theory needed to understand git's most abstruse 
concepts, like ``rebase``, ``cherrypick``, ``octopus-merge``,
``interactive rebase``, ``revert`` and ``reset``.

Let's go to practice.
